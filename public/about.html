<h1>About Me</h1>

  pursuits, I enjoy cooking and playing games. . ---

  I am a dedicated software developer and product designer with four years of
  experience in creating beautiful user experiences and helping companies scale
  their projects. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I am
  continually enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  Saturdays are my work-free days, which I use to relax, play football, and
  spend time with friends
